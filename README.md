# TRIVIAL-SWANK

An experimental client for SWANK servers, written in Common Lisp.

For an example of how to use it, see [the Subtext repl demo](https://github.com/stacksmith/subtext).

To start a swank server in a separate Lisp process, do something like:

```
sbcl --load "start-swank.lisp"
```

The Emacs slime log buffer is probably your best resource.
